Part 1: I only made the ramps and player as they are the core of the game and I did not have time to make the rest. The player moves when you press right arrow. I also did not have time to add a feature where you can miss the landing.

Part 2: I made the toon shader and put it on the player as this is where your attention is and the toon shader makes the player pop so you can focus on the player even more. The toon shader is made by taking the diffuse lighting and multiplying by 0.5 and adding 0.5 to get 1. You use that to calculate the ramp and then use the ramp value and multiply it by the light colour.

Part 3: I did not have enough time to add Color grading

Part 4: I added rim lighting to the obstacles as i think it highlights the obstacles well as it draw attention to the obstacles. I changed the rim power a bit to make it more noticeable.
